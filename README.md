This example demonstrates a common pitfall in F# when mixing mutable and immutable variables. The function `addOne` receives a copy of the mutable variable `x`, increments it, and returns the incremented value.  However, the original mutable variable `x` remains unchanged. This might lead to unexpected behavior if the programmer expects `addOne` to modify `x` in place. The solution shows how to properly modify a mutable variable within a function.
